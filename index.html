    <p>Mr. Watson was born in Campbell, N.Y., February 17, 1874. His first job was at age 18 as a bookkeeper in Clarence
        Risley's Market in Painted Post, N.Y. Later he sold sewing machines and musical instruments before joining the
        National Cash Register Company as a salesman in Buffalo. He eventually worked his way up to general sales
        manager. Bent on inspiring the dispirited NCR sales force, Mr. Watson introduced the motto, "THINK," which later
        became a widely known symbol of IBM.</p>

    <p1>The first step was the construction of the Harvard Mark I calculator designed by Howard Aiken. IBM was selected
        as the "prime contractor" company but also had to provide expertise and experience from its card processing and
        unit record business to supplement Aiken's ideas and to complete the project. At the dedication ceremony Aiken
        snubbed Watson and IBM's contributions, and a never-to-be-mended rift developed between the two men. Although
        Columbia University had been influential in its promotion of mechanical computing systems in the T.J. Watson
        Astronomical Computing Bureau, IBM had never taken advantage of this expertise to move into the computer
        business. [See biography of Wallace Eckert.] Subsequently IBM constructed the Selective Sequence Electronic
        Computer (SSEC) machine, installed it in its headquarters on Madison Avenue, New York, and opened a service
        bureau to provide computing utilities to the public. The Korean War provided an impetus to allow IBM to show its
        nationalistic pride by offering to build a "Defense Calculator" to serve the war effort. This machine, later
        designated as the Type 701 machine, became the first of the two major series of mainframe computers central to
        its success.</p1>

        <li>One day my dad went into a roadside saloon to celebrate a sale and had too much to drink. When the bar
            closed, he found that his entire rig horse, buggy, and samples had been stolen. Wheeler and Wilson fired him
            and dunned him for the lost property. Word got around, of course, and it took Dad more than a year to find
            another steady job.</li>
        <li>In 1941, Watson received the third highest salary and compensation package in the U.S., $517,221, on which
            he paid 69% in tax.</li>
        <li>In 1985 the story was discussed on Usenet (in net.misc), without Watson's name being attached.</li>

                <th><hr>Born in Dayton, Ohio in 1914, Thomas Watson, Jr. earned a B.A. degree from Brown University in 1937.
                    He started his career with IBM as a salesman, but put it on hold to serve for five years as a pilot
                    in the U.S. Army Air Corps. During his service, he rose to the rating of Senior Pilot and the rank
                    of Lieutenant Colonel. He then returned to IBM to continue his career.<hr></th>

                <th><hr>Mr. Watson was elected President of the company in January 1952, made Chief Executive Officer in
                    May, 1956, and elected Chairman of the Board in May, 1961. Thomas Watson stepped down as Chairman
                    and CEO in 1971, a year after suffering a heart attack, but he remained a member of IBMâ€™s Board of
                    Directors until 1984, except for a brief time out from 1979 to 1981 to serve as U.S. Ambassador to
                    the Soviet Union.<hr></th>

                <th><hr>Watson saw IBM grow from a medium-sized business to one of the largest industrial corporations in
                    the world. He also saw growth in the area of employees from 72,500 to more than 270,000 employees at
                    the time that he stepped down in 1971. During the same timeframe, IBM went from a gross income of
                    $892 million to $8.3 billion.<hr></th>
